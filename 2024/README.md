Most days have tests that confirm my input still maps to the answers that worked
and other tests that were useful in development. Code quality varies greatly by day
based on free time.

## Usage

Run them all

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or confirm them all

```bash
go test ./...
```

For development, it's usually most helpful to work via tests for the given day.

## TODO

- [x] add basic build GHA
- [x] fix up running for days 1 and 2
- [ ] add day 1 tests
- [x] add golangci-lint configuration

There are many "IMPROVEMENT" statements, that I don't currently plan to come back to ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
